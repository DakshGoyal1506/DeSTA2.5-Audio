# üìä Evaluation Tips

DeSTA2.5-Audio is a highly flexible model designed to handle a wide range of natural language instructions. It supports customization of both the system prompt and the user prompt, allowing it to adapt to various evaluation tasks ‚Äî from simple auditory perception to complex multi-step reasoning.

Because the model is built on an instruction-tuned language model, it may exhibit behaviors such as:

- Providing explanations or justifications in its responses
- Starting with conversational phrases (e.g., ‚ÄúSure!‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet me help‚Äù)
- Producing fluent, natural-sounding output instead of strictly formatted answers

These characteristics showcase the strength of a well-aligned audio language model. However, they can introduce challenges in format-sensitive evaluations like **ASR or Multiple-choice questions**, where strict output formatting is essential.

To keep things fair and consistent, our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02768) uses a simple and standardized setup with minimal prompt engineering. More advanced prompts, like chain-of-thought or task-specific templates, could improve results and are worth exploring in future work. 

Please consider using the following prompts for your evaluation:

| Question type     | System Prompt                                                                 | User Prompt                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default           | Focus on the audio clips and instruction.                                     | <\|AUDIO\|> {instruction}                                                                                        |
| Multiple-choice   | Focus on the audio clips and instruction. Choose one of the options without any explanation. | <\|AUDIO\|> {instruction}\nThe answer could be: "{option_1}", {option_2} or {option_3}                       |
| Dialogue-based    | You are a voice assistant. Act as if you are a natural language partner       | <\|AUDIO\|>                                                                                                      |
| ASR (word-level metrics) | Focus on the audio clips and instruction. Respond directly without any other words | <\|AUDIO\|> {instruction}                                                                                        |
